## 💡 Key Findings and Business Insights

### 1. 📈 Overall Performance and Growth
- **Volume Growth:** Order Count and Customer Count show strong growth, peaking in **2016 and 2017**, indicating successful market expansion and customer acquisition.
- **Declining Value:** Despite increasing order volume, **Average Sales per Order** has declined or stagnated since 2014  
  *(e.g., $250.09 in 2014 → $230.31 in 2017)*, implying smaller average transaction sizes.
- **Recommendation:** Introduce upselling and cross-selling strategies to increase average order value.

### 3. 🌍 Regional and Segment Performance
- **Top Region:** The **West Region** contributes the highest order volume (approx. 30–34% of all orders).
- **Strong Segments:** **Corporate** and **Home Office** segments show consistently stronger **profit margins** compared to Consumer.
